I am Cai ruiguang.

During this course, I have learnt version control, some knowledge about github and how to upload our documents on the github. 

Addtionally, some basic codes and commands about python have also be learned in this course.

I have also learnt to write careful instructions when communicating online!

As for the poster, I learn much about the teamwork
